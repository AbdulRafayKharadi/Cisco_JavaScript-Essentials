    <h1>Question 1: Let's play florist. Declare six variables, remembering to name them according to their purpose:</h1>
    <p>the price of a single rose (8) and the number of roses you have (70)
    <br>the price of a single lily (10) and the number of lilies you have (50)
    <br>the price of a single tulip (2) and the number of tulips you have (120)
    <br>Now declare three variables, one each for the roses, lilies, and tulips you have, in which you place their total price.
    <br>Insert the corresponding values into the variables using the variables declared in the previous step.
    <br>Finally, declare a variable in which you store the price of all your flowers (again, use the previous variables for initialization).
    <br>Display all inventory information in the console in the following form:</p>
    
    <h1>Question 2: Modify the code from the previous example.</h1>
    <p>Assume that the prices of flowers will be constant (they will not change).
    <br>Declare and initialize the remaining variables in the same way as in the previous example.
    <br>Display all the gathered information in the console. Now decrease the number of roses by 20 and lilies by 30.
    <br>Display all the collected information in the console again.</p>
